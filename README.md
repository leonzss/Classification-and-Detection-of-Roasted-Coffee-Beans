# Description Classification and Detection of Roasted Coffee Beans with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview

This project focuses on the classification and detection of roasted coffee beans using computer vision and machine learning techniques.
The goal is to develop a robust system that can accurately identify and classify different types of roasted coffee beans based on their visual characteristics.

## Features

+ **Image Classification**: Implement a CNN-based model for the classification of roasted coffee beans into distinct categories, including bean type, roast level, and origin.

+ **Object Detection**: Utilize CNN architecture to create an object detection system that can identify and outline individual coffee beans in images.

+ **Dataset Preparation**: Provide tools and scripts for preparing and augmenting datasets suitable for training CNN models.

+ **Model Evaluation**: Implement metrics and tools for evaluating the performance of the classification and detection models.

## Technologies Used

+ **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: Employ popular deep learning frameworks for CNN model development and training.

+ **OpenCV**: Apply computer vision techniques for image preprocessing, augmentation, and feature extraction.

+ **Python**: Use Python as the primary programming language for implementation.
